Project Title: “Lodgify”
  "Lodgify" is our flagship project that showcases our dedication, teamwork, and technical expertise. Designed as a comprehensive solution for managing accommodation, it integrates advanced features with a user-friendly interface to streamline operations in the hospitality sector.
  As a team, we poured our efforts into every aspect of this project, striving to deliver a product that meets both functional and aesthetic standards. "Lodgify" represents the culmination of our learning and creativity, reflecting our commitment to excellence and innovation.

Overview
  "Lodgify" is a comprehensive hotel management system that also incorporates restaurant management functionalities. It addresses several common challenges faced by the hospitality industry, such as:
    •	Inefficient handling of reservations and bookings.
    •	High operational costs due to manual or outdated processes.
    •	Lack of accurate and up-to-date information for managing resources.
    •	The need for separate portals to handle hotel and restaurant operations, leading to fragmented workflows.

Solutions:
  We designed "Lodgify" as an all-in-one system that:
    •	Streamlines the management of room bookings, staff assignments, and resource tracking.
    •	Enhance restaurant management by integrating menu handling, order processing, and billing into the same platform.
    •	Provides centralized, real-time data for better decision-making.
    •	It is scalable and open for further updates to incorporate new features and improvements based on user feedback.
  Our focus was to deliver a solution that is efficient, cost-effective, and easy to use while offering features that cater to both hotel and restaurant management needs.

Functionality of the Project
  "Lodgify" operates through four major portals, each tailored to specific roles and functionalities to ensure smooth hotel and restaurant management:

1. Administration Portal
  The administration portal handles foundational operations that enable access to other functionalities:
    •	Employee Management: Employees must first be added through the administration portal to access their respective roles and portals.
    •	Room Management: Rooms are added here with availability marked as "Yes" or "No" and status as "Clean" or "Dirty." These attributes allow further booking processes.
    •	Car Management: Cars for guest use are added with their availability status ("Yes" or "No"), enabling bookings by drivers and receptionists.
    •	Once rooms or cars are added and configured, subsequent procedures (e.g., booking or updating) can take place.

2. Hotel Receptionist Portal
  The receptionist portal manages operations typically performed by a hotel receptionist:
    •	View Available Rooms: Displays rooms marked as available.
    •	Room Booking: Books rooms for customers based on availability.
    •	Customer Management:
    o	Updates customer information using booked room numbers or CNIC.
    o	Checks customers out when they wish to leave.
    •	Room Hygiene Management: Allows the receptionist to view and update room statuses (Clean/Dirty).
    •	Car Booking Status: Manages car bookings by viewing or updating their availability status.


3. Staff Service Portal
  The staff service portal simplifies duties for hotel staff, including drivers and sweepers:
    •	Driver Portal:
    o	Allows drivers to view all cars or specific ones by entering the car ID.
    o	Updates the booked status of cars as necessary.
    •	Sweeper Portal:
    o	Enables sweepers to view all room statuses (Clean/Dirty) or a specific room by entering its room number.
    o	Updates room cleaning statuses to ensure hygiene.

4. Restaurant Portal
  The restaurant portal is designed to manage the hotel's restaurant:
  •	Menu Management:
    o	Add menu items with their details.
    o	Update or delete existing menu items.
    o	Add multiple sizes for one item, but only one entry for each specific size.
    o	View the complete menu.
    •	Order Management:
    o	Place orders for customers, ensuring items, sizes, and amounts are available in the inventory.
    o	Maintain a record of previously placed orders for tracking purposes.

  Database Integration
      To address the risk of data deletion or loss, we incorporated a database system that writes all data to files. This ensures that:
      •	All data is securely stored and can be retrieved when needed.
      •	The system retains its state even after restarts, avoiding any loss of crucial information.
  User Interface
      We prioritized a user-friendly and intuitive interface to minimize complexity, ensuring that the software can be easily used by others without technical expertise.
